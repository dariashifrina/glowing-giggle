#explanation: we used cumulative probability, since random does not account for weighted probabilities as all of the values in its range have an equal probability of being picked. first, we generated a random float that stood for a random percentage(0-100%). then we summed up the dictionary probabilities in the cumulative_probability. the moment the cumulative probability exceeded the random percentage, we returned that value. this method is efficient because dictionary keys are picked in random order so there's no order ruining the randonmness(a parallel would be a bag with different amounts of colorful balls and randomly taking out one!)
